### Description:

The main concepts worked on in this project were the use of display grid, responsiveness of various elements and mobile development.

As a basic project developed in HTML and CSS, I developed it my way, using ReactJS and Tailwind, to practice the basic concepts and review already learned concepts of HTML and CSS.
